This work displays information of death certificates in Mexico for the period 1998-2017.
The main source is the National Institute of Statistics (INEGI), but I also used data from CONAPO (National Council of Population), CONEVAL (National Council of Policy Evaluation), and other sources.
The  goal of the project is to produce data visualizations of mortality in Mexico, with a special focus on suicides.
INEGI only provides information per year, so I built the entire dataset using the "micro-data" datasets provided by INEGI.
