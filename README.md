This work displays information of death certificates in Mexico for the period 1998-2017.
The main source is the National Institute of Statistics (INEGI), but I also added data from CONAPO, CONEVAL, and others.
The main goal of the project is to produce data visualizations of mortality in Mexico, with a special focus on suicides and a few other mortality causes.
INEGI provides information per year, so I built the entire dataset using the "micro-data" datasets provided by INEGI.
